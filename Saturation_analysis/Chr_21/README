These files can be used to generate plots in Figure S1.

First run the file LCL_chr21_run_saturation_analysis.sh.
This file is used to select specific numbers of sample subsets to iterate through this script: LCL_chr21_SaturationAnalysis.R

Next, run LCL_plot_chr21_SaturationAnalysis.R using the output from the first step to generate plots.
