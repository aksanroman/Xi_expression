These files can be used to generate plots in Figure S1.

First run the file LCL_run_saturation_analysis.sh.
This file is used to select specific numbers of sample subsets to iterate through these two scripts: LCL_NPY_SaturationAnalysis.R and LCL_NPX_PAR_SaturationAnalysis.R. 

Next, run LCL_Plot_SaturationAnalysis.R using the output from the first step to generate plots.
