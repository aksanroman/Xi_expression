First run the file Fib_run_saturation_analysis.sh.
This file is used to select specific numbers of sample subsets to iterate through these two scripts: Fib_NPY_SaturationAnalysis.R and Fib_NPX_PAR_SaturationAnalysis.R. 

Next, run Fib_Plot_SaturationAnalysis.R using the output from the first step to generate plots.
