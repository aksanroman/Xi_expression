Any of several different proteinaceous coats that can associate with membranes. Membrane coats include those formed by clathrin plus an adaptor complex, the COPI and COPII complexes, and possibly others. They are found associated with membranes on many vesicles as well as other membrane features such as pits and perhaps tubules [goid 30117] [evidence IEA]; A clathrin coat found on a vesicle of the trans-Golgi network [goid 30130] [evidence IEA]; A membrane coat adaptor complex that links clathrin to a membrane [goid 30131] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; That part of the cytoplasm that does not contain membranous or particulate subcellular components [goid 5829] [pmid 15569716] [evidence EXP]; An invagination of the cell membrane of many eukaryotic cells, concerned in receptor-mediated selective transport of many proteins and other macromolecules across the cell membrane.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment.

A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent [goid 5634] [evidence IEA]; A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome [goid 5730] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]	The progression of biochemical and morphological phases and events that occur in a cell during successive cell replication or nuclear replication events.

In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent [goid 5634] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus.

It passes many of the materials to lysosomes for degradation [goid 5768] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; Penetrating at least one phospholipid bilayer of a plasma membrane.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]					X	7380768	7380768	42248	ILMN_1811121	7380768	iujJP_CuFuPeygiew0	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	GTGGATAGCATTTTGAAGGTGACCGTGATTCTGTAGGAAGAGCTGTAATC	NA	NA	NA	NA	139231	chrX:103435757:103435806:+	FAM199X	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	103435757	103435806	+	NA	NA	NA	NA		7.587336	8.048452	7.888113	8.036653	8.043948	7.971523	7.969834	7.969129	8.029462	8.01527	7.780015	7.651486	7.661357	7.83947	8.075769	7.706737	7.628258	7.78839	7.632519	7.741866	7.642992	7.769042	7.833086	7.663663	8.043678	7.80039	7.701167	7.870708	7.770313	7.840215	7.781397	7.771899	7.770108	7.861891	7.738444	7.704186	7.833086	7.77501	7.775223	7.69333	7.65511	7.80613	7.798205	7.602163	7.876962	8.001468	7.599944	7.728764	7.724091	7.838742	7.671633	7.990092	7.775223	7.800494	7.886195	7.660704	7.763872	7.924302	7.89739	7.919631	7.763872	7.957776	7.882574	7.881902	7.970701	7.768119	7.843665	8.027976

It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus.

A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]		Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 17137291] [evidence IPI]	MAGE-C1; MGC39366; CT7	MAGE-C1; MGC39366; CT7	X	10446	10446	11914	ILMN_1720041	10446	ri.cbroqXr4p6IgRLk	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	GAGTTTCTACGTGGTGGAGGGCCTGGTTGAGGCTGGAGAGAACACAGTGC	NA	NA	NA	rs41300301	9947	chrX:140996663:140996712:+	MAGEC1	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	140996663	140996712	+	NA	NA	NA	NA		6.712406	6.574596	6.311988	6.577897	6.464296	6.569417	6.66221	6.294673	6.452082	6.595465	6.461116	6.511363	6.709157	6.477445	6.544306	6.452325	6.392487	6.628474	6.510371	6.461012	6.411565	6.461208	6.389472	6.611721	6.553875	6.440442	6.564853	6.40477	6.493365	6.55882	6.628207	6.458323	6.48767	6.492575	6.5412	6.439225	6.5161	6.526133	6.455374	6.477057	6.586042	6.542541	6.562285	6.473654	6.373692	6.442219	6.54835	6.489096	6.501406	6.553854	6.519492	6.349277	6.673421	6.507147	6.514233	6.658936	6.590582	6.556986	6.476897	6.5161	6.644983	6.496924	6.431289	6.313458	6.447584	6.569642	6.390163	6.385868

A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent [goid 5634] [pmid 14623885] [evidence ISS]; All of the contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures [goid 5737] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; Any of the various filamentous elements that form the internal framework of cells, and typically remain after treatment of the cells with mild detergent to remove membrane constituents and soluble components of the cytoplasm. The term embraces intermediate filaments, microfilaments, microtubules, the microtrabecular lattice, and other structures characterized by a polymeric filamentous nature and long-range order within the cell. The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions, including cellular movement, cell division, endocytosis, and movement of organelles [goid 5856] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer and associated proteins [goid 5886] [pmid 14623885] [evidence ISS]; A multiprotein complex that forms a strong mechanical link between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; typical of, but not confined to, muscle cells. The complex is composed of transmembrane, cytoplasmic, and extracellular proteins, including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, dystroglycan, dystrobrevins, syntrophins, sarcospan, caveolin-3, and NO synthase [goid 16010] [pmid 14623885] [evidence ISS]; A branching protoplasmic process of a neuron that receive and integrate signals coming from axons of other neurons, and convey the resulting signal to the body of the cell [goid 30425] [pmid 14623885] [evidence ISS]; A specialized area of membrane facing the presynaptic membrane on the tip of the nerve ending and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft). Neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane [goid 45211] [pmid 14623885] [evidence ISS]; Cytoplasm situated near, or occurring around, the nucleus [goid 48471] [pmid 14623885] [evidence ISS]	Any process specifically pertinent to the functioning of integrated living units: cells, tissues, organs, and organisms.

It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus.

DNA is also damaged because of errors during its replication. A variety of different DNA repair pathways have been reported that include direct reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, photoreactivation, bypass, double-strand break repair pathway, and mismatch repair pathway [goid 6281] [evidence IEA]; The synthesis of either RNA on a template of DNA or DNA on a template of RNA [goid 6350] [evidence IEA]; Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of DNA-dependent transcription [goid 6355] [evidence IEA]; The alteration of DNA or protein in chromatin, which may result in changing the chromatin structure [goid 16568] [evidence IEA]	Elemental activities, such as catalysis or binding, describing the actions of a gene product at the molecular level.

All of the contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures [goid 5737] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IPI]	The process of introducing a phosphate group on to a protein [goid 6468] [pmid 11641781] [evidence IDA]; Any process that modulates the occurrence or rate of cell death by apoptosis [goid 42981] [pmid 11741893] [evidence IDA]; The process of introducing a phosphate group on to a protein [goid 6468] [evidence IEA]; The process of introducing a phosphate group on to a protein [goid 6468] [evidence IEA]; The process of introducing a phosphate group on to a protein [goid 6468] [evidence IEA]	Interacting selectively with a nucleotide, any compound consisting of a nucleoside that is esterified with (ortho)phosphate or an oligophosphate at any hydroxyl group on the ribose or deoxyribose moiety [goid 166] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with magnesium (Mg) ions [goid 287] [pmid 11641781] [evidence IDA]; Catalysis of the reaction: ATP + a protein serine/threonine = ADP + protein serine/threonine phosphate [goid 4674] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with ATP, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, a universally important coenzyme and enzyme regulator [goid 5524] [pmid 11641781] [evidence IDA]; Catalysis of the transfer of a group, e.g. a methyl group, glycosyl group, acyl group, phosphorus-containing, or other groups, from one compound (generally regarded as the donor) to another compound (generally regarded as the acceptor).

A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent [goid 5634] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome [goid 5730] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; Any of the various filamentous elements that form the internal framework of cells, and typically remain after treatment of the cells with mild detergent to remove membrane constituents and soluble components of the cytoplasm. The term embraces intermediate filaments, microfilaments, microtubules, the microtrabecular lattice, and other structures characterized by a polymeric filamentous nature and long-range order within the cell. The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions, including cellular movement, cell division, endocytosis, and movement of organelles [goid 5856] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]	A defense response that is mediated by cells [goid 6968] [pmid 9651357] [evidence TAS]		GAGEB1; GAGE-9; PAGE-1	GAGEB1; GAGE-9; PAGE-1	X	7160735	7160735	42726	ILMN_1778623	7160735	ZruXmA4IkjgHlZIKlI	Perfect****	3	Transcriptomic	GGTGTGCCTGCGAAATGAAGAGCAGATGAAACTGCCCGCAGAAGGGCCAG	NA	chrX:49455851:49455895:-	NA	NA	8712	chrX:49455852:49455895:-,chrX:49454141:49454146:-	PAGE1	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	49455852	49455895	-	NA	NA	NA	NA		6.426076	6.531118	6.315845	6.260717	6.516055	6.369385	6.345708	6.433394	6.372172	6.198137	6.470587	6.359954	6.296716	6.239158	6.438499	6.36866	6.293973	6.299014	6.305606	6.350398	6.320988	6.600279	6.328972	6.341605	6.431971	6.374158	6.447921	6.440933	6.401709	6.228643	6.42435	6.281855	6.34322	6.391834	6.219169	6.460724	6.5161	6.242382	6.303241	6.310427	6.463214	6.346183	6.566654	6.262333	6.330841	6.263008	6.182653	6.343733	6.345308	6.290888	6.346133	6.296716	6.353308	6.420346	6.337465	6.363808	6.326518	6.226378	6.299402	6.375505	6.554567	6.500183	6.486062	6.28998	6.379403	6.177244	6.421531	6.602257

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; The network of interconnected tubular and cisternal structures located at the side of the Golgi apparatus distal to the endoplasmic reticulum, from which secretory vesicles emerge.

The lipid bilayer surrounding any of the compartments of the Golgi apparatus [goid 139] [evidence IEA]; A cytoplasmic, membrane-bounded organelle that is found in most animal cells and that contains a variety of hydrolases, most of which have their maximal activities in the pH range 5-6. The contained enzymes display latency if properly isolated. About 40 different lysosomal hydrolases are known and lysosomes have a great variety of morphologies and functions [goid 5764] [pmid 15078902] [evidence IDA]; A prelysosomal endocytic organelle differentiated from early endosomes by lower lumenal pH and different protein composition.

The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. The ER takes two forms, rough (or granular), with ribosomes adhering to the outer surface, and smooth (with no ribosomes attached) [goid 5783] [evidence IEA]; The lipid bilayer surrounding the endoplasmic reticulum [goid 5789] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment.

Isomerase is the systematic name for any enzyme of EC class 5 [goid 16853] [evidence IEA]; Catalysis of the reaction: N-acyl-D-glucosamine = N-acyl-D-mannosamine [goid 50121] [evidence IEA]	RNBP; RBP	RNBP; RBP	X	5810678	5810678	41317	ILMN_1780057	5810678	W.QKefUblmuXJTuYog	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	TTTCAAAGGCTGCTTCCACGTGCCGCGGTGCCTAGCCATGTGCGAGGAGA	NA	chrX:153200816:153200859:-	NA	NA	5973	chrX:153200942:153200949:-,chrX:153200816:153200857:-	RENBP	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	153200942	153200949	-	NA	NA	NA	NA		7.04684	6.616243	6.85721	6.567458	6.466112	6.711805	6.401144	6.925247	6.83436	6.761879	6.811323	7.180371	6.550747	6.565378	6.649373	6.793519	6.967328	6.479245	6.666917	6.509535	6.862511	6.678905	6.636134	6.633599	6.779668	6.851362	6.458993	6.525306	6.61197	6.738178	6.760596	6.738568	6.778993	6.745781	6.672893	6.72029	6.644455	7.005735	6.805503	6.722293	6.968172	6.633456	6.725541	6.700713	6.518983	6.638237	6.940034	6.978747	6.953041	6.633169	6.689299	6.661878	6.739434	6.472236	6.700049	6.736235	6.673879	6.622155	6.685968	6.677993	6.631899	6.642616	6.844182	6.520511	6.719133	6.896166	6.706425	6.812751

All of the contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures [goid 5737] [evidence IEA]; A prelysosomal endocytic organelle differentiated from early endosomes by lower lumenal pH and different protein composition. Late endosomes are more spherical than early endosomes and are mostly juxtanuclear, being concentrated near the microtubule organizing center [goid 5770] [evidence IEA]; The irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. The ER takes two forms, rough (or granular), with ribosomes adhering to the outer surface, and smooth (with no ribosomes attached) [goid 5783] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face).

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome [goid 5730] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]			753P9; CXorf9; SH3D6C; SLY	753P9; CXorf9; SLY; SH3D6C	X	4730037	4730037	25622	ILMN_1697554	4730037	EqXV_FUsYLc5Xg1Uiw	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	GGGCCTCCCTTGACCCCAGTACGAAGTCTATGCCCTGAATCCCCAGAGTA	NA	NA	NA	NA	54440	chrX:128928936:128928985:+	SASH3	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	128928936	128928985	+	NA	NA	NA	NA		9.435946	9.105147	9.601406	9.133681	9.072085	9.667599	9.08033	9.328127	9.382624	9.316849	9.276537	9.790752	9.525543	9.386503	9.599088	9.167824	9.438976	9.20991	9.266918	9.281195	9.420785	9.327559	9.045775	9.355933	9.757249	9.506125	9.451919	9.401318	9.550473	9.304147	9.266918	9.000464	9.007288	9.403069	9.49452	9.070899	9.229442	9.61421	9.305407	9.175054	9.53195	9.370918	9.68853	9.724831	9.302047	9.305407	9.397753	9.668331	9.567171	9.1867	9.374469	9.449271	9.390835	9.25565	9.469063	9.434816	9.555216	9.137368	9.523921	9.56862	9.300301	9.319392	9.669816	9.266546	9.280563	9.336598	9.400125	9.352382

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 11279194] [evidence IDA]; The network of interconnected tubular and cisternal structures located at the side of the Golgi apparatus distal to the endoplasmic reticulum, from which secretory vesicles emerge.

Force generation involves a chemo-mechanical energy conversion step. The chemo-mechanical energy conversion step is carried out by the actin/myosin complex activity, which generates force through ATP hydrolysis. Striated muscle is a type of muscle in which the repeating units (sarcomeres) of the contractile myofibrils are arranged in registry throughout the cell, resulting in transverse or oblique striations observable at the level of the light microscope [goid 6941] [pmid 10598820] [evidence TAS]				X	1010093	1010093	3959	ILMN_1778743	1010093	xVF2jiiCCUPUomCAfU	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	CCCACCTCGGATGAGGAGAAGAAGCCAATTCCAGGAGCGAAGAAACTTCC	NA	NA	NA	NA	23676	chrX:21755757:21755806:-	SMPX	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	21755757	21755806	-	NA	NA	NA	NA		6.55759	6.612427	6.626213	6.560004	6.307993	6.448817	6.701768	6.590476	6.385553	6.460032	6.615694	6.440021	6.460009	6.470954	6.7021	6.478311	6.515411	6.386792	6.566086	6.374574	6.325809	6.529953	6.557137	6.434487	6.540622	6.540273	6.692112	6.5359	6.509134	6.554719	6.453833	6.54132	6.730716	6.546916	6.498543	6.460724	6.412853	6.340289	6.436483	6.477057	6.376263	6.535407	6.62166	6.73429	6.465469	6.552534	6.492666	6.517165	6.37379	6.633169	6.513121	6.618127	6.453671	6.550779	6.452627	6.505784	6.430252	6.545568	6.476897	6.658936	6.504329	6.49017	6.355841	6.493974	6.567051	6.319437	6.520732	6.641792

An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process by which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [evidence IEA]; The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the forebrain over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The forebrain is the anterior of the three primary divisions of the developing chordate brain or the corresponding part of the adult brain (in vertebrates, includes especially the cerebral hemispheres, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus and especially in higher vertebrates is the main control center for sensory and associative information processing, visceral functions, and voluntary motor functions) [goid 30900] [evidence IEA]; The process whereby a relatively unspecialized cell acquires the specialized features of a spermatid cell [goid 48515] [evidence IEA]	Interacting selectively with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) [goid 3677] [pmid 8625802] [evidence TAS]	SOXB; MRGH	SOXB; MRGH	X	3310037	3310037	5285	ILMN_1653055	3310037	KlDvD8yUrubu3Vl2WU	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	GCCAATGTTAATTTATAGCCAGGTGTGCGTGTGTCTCCCGCCTCGCCGCC	NA	NA	NA	NA	6658	chrX:139585335:139585384:-	SOX3	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	NON_PAR_XYhom	139585335	139585384	-	NA	NA	NA	NA		6.353756	6.536119	6.491989	6.406244	6.516055	6.52144	6.389993	6.505269	6.586972	6.455177	6.497779	6.240046	6.378731	6.561167	6.554308	6.565056	6.603773	6.455049	6.378829	6.537038	6.401168	6.487716	6.357143	6.565636	6.521938	6.353706	6.329932	6.410598	6.411159	6.38565	6.301193	6.542716	6.509535	6.422858	6.514511	6.443667	6.488191	6.4552	6.530854	6.439693	6.403762	6.569877	6.39026	6.289006	6.389654	6.557278	6.711291	6.459339	6.376153	6.577578	6.473403	6.470702	6.634642	6.4887	6.515833	6.455223	6.410203	6.366027	6.485608	6.367196	6.504329	6.446734	6.691621	6.531063	6.377559	6.449236	6.303009	6.40148

Most of the TAFs are conserved across species. In TATA-containing promoters for RNA polymerase II (Pol II), TFIID is believed to recognize at least two distinct elements, the TATA element and a downstream promoter element.

It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus.

The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]	The directed movement of substances (such as macromolecules, small molecules, ions) into, out of, within or between cells, or within a multicellular organism [goid 6810] [evidence IEA]; The directed movement of substances from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, mediated by COP II vesicles. Small COP II coated vesicles form from the ER and then fuse directly with the cis-Golgi.

This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome [goid 5730] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; All of the contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures [goid 5737] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]			DKFZp779C2057; FLJ20563; MG21	DKFZp779C2057; FLJ20563; MG21	X	2190364	2190364	25803	ILMN_1805512	2190364	HRe5_O0n0HmGIlx6XU	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	CACCTGTGCTTGATGTCAGCTTCAACTGCGACGAGAGCCTACTGGCCTCC	NA	NA	NA	NA	64743	chrX:48463323:48463372:+	WDR13	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	48463323	48463372	+	NA	NA	NA	NA		8.520361	8.358029	8.416518	8.515336	8.536198	8.591541	8.589957	8.735961	8.432474	8.614979	8.588218	8.817709	8.245693	8.578737	8.389693	8.386063	8.538317	8.418233	8.299801	8.333486	8.291424	8.379027	8.465951	8.282152	8.142488	8.397449	8.438124	8.042237	8.44519	8.310114	8.290103	8.416349	8.492259	8.312774	8.606668	8.408617	8.302809	8.52756	8.295543	8.47199	8.682253	8.339599	7.979471	8.500174	8.237469	8.343918	8.273264	8.669684	8.167906	8.181404	8.302101	8.210874	8.306177	8.363678	8.425172	8.364283	8.462286	8.221284	8.577115	8.234247	8.367129	8.544072	8.442132	8.07592	8.385929	8.272801	8.246824	8.299227

It passes many of the materials to lysosomes for degradation [goid 5768] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; The lipid bilayer surrounding an endosome [goid 10008] [evidence IEA]; Double layer of lipid molecules that encloses all cells, and, in eukaryotes, many organelles; may be a single or double lipid bilayer; also includes associated proteins [goid 16020] [evidence IEA]			DKFZp686L20145; RAB11BP; MGC26781; RPH11	DKFZp686L20145; RAB11BP; MGC26781; RPH11	X	2140681	2140681	44730	ILMN_2178618	2140681	cUOAwTeqQ4BXjTvvjo	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	CCAATGAAATAACATCTGGGGCAATGAAACCCTGATCATGTTGTTGATGG	NA	NA	NA	NA	54521	chrX:117583811:117583860:+	WDR44	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	117583811	117583860	+	NA	NA	NA	NA		7.832364	7.853701	7.928162	7.928049	7.939819	7.62682	8.092638	7.633589	8.185825	7.908676	7.899753	7.744095	7.8011	7.655785	8.191911	7.779784	7.896763	7.85439	7.713297	7.794828	7.583411	7.887156	7.384544	7.578753	7.618561	7.877762	7.932485	7.738863	7.918939	8.072761	7.616989	7.722139	7.792034	7.905493	8.116139	7.771796	7.611326	7.408877	7.850587	7.712106	7.913833	7.589844	7.667456	7.563065	7.75284	7.74737	7.905018	7.492654	7.520007	7.698856	7.682372	8.018741	7.469751	7.878055	7.650738	7.550281	7.762038	7.595155	7.906764	7.644923	7.708924	7.722524	7.557844	7.551646	7.704079	7.735158	7.668151	7.860689

In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent [goid 5634] [pmid 10207085] [evidence TAS]; A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome [goid 5730] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; All of the contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures [goid 5737] [evidence IEA]; The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer and associated proteins [goid 5886] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]	The synthesis of either RNA on a template of DNA or DNA on a template of RNA [goid 6350] [evidence IEA]; Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of DNA-dependent transcription [goid 6355] [evidence IEA]; A series of reactions within the cell that occur as a result of a single trigger reaction or compound [goid 7242] [pmid 10207085] [evidence TAS]; The series of molecular signals initiated by binding of Wnt protein to a frizzled family receptor on the surface of the target cell and ending with a change in cell state [goid 16055] [evidence IEA]	Interacting selectively with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) [goid 3677] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 10207085] [evidence TAS]; Interacting selectively with zinc (Zn) ions [goid 8270] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any metal ion [goid 46872] [evidence IEA]	ZNF348; ZNF-kaiso	ZNF348; ZNF-kaiso	X	4290615	4290615	5475	ILMN_1673138	4290615	Nken96etBzOAX709dY	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	GCACTGGCTTTCTGGCTGGTCAACTATATGAAACCTTGTTCATTCCTCCG	chr9:136118516:136118564:-	NA	NA	NA	10009	chrX:119392078:119392127:+	ZBTB33	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	119392078	119392127	+	chr9	chr9	136118516	136118564	-	10.81195	10.79607	10.44499	10.64227	10.47219	10.61488	10.75499	10.72178	10.81073	10.62931	10.62074	10.45615	10.39181	10.44954	10.47067	10.20293	10.30919	10.36029	10.20646	10.19581	10.54952	10.40949	10.32234	10.20941	10.30147	10.49838	10.31346	10.60919	10.38638	10.29701	10.38297	10.28271	10.42101	10.58241	10.49314	10.21722	10.08012	10.44578	10.38732	10.38988	10.29141	10.32622	10.4737	10.52787	10.49603	10.53687	10.47143	10.45615	10.35448	10.4063	10.32696	10.59803	10.36635	10.35728	10.67207	10.41945	10.49274	10.26968	10.3028	10.52241	10.50933	10.36297	10.67857	10.26138	10.33581	10.45991	10.5765	10.46606

The irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. The ER takes two forms, rough (or granular), with ribosomes adhering to the outer surface, and smooth (with no ribosomes attached) [goid 5783] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]		Interacting selectively with zinc (Zn) ions [goid 8270] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any metal ion [goid 46872] [evidence IEA]	CXorf32	CXorf32	X	630195	630195	12172	ILMN_1814629	630195	x8FIri4AzJX1Uv_3lU	Perfect	3	Transcriptomic	TTAACCAGAGGTGAGTGAAAATATAGCCCTTCCCCAGTTTTGTCTGCCCC	NA	NA	NA	rs5964981	340554	chrX:64727549:64727598:+	ZC3H12B	NA	NA	NA	chrX	chrX	chrX	X	64727549	64727598	+	NA	NA	NA	NA		6.661608	6.494977	6.652032	6.997251	6.833861	6.797598	6.565335	6.846356	6.504956	6.50813	6.62574	6.581551	6.475665	6.692014	6.408387	6.712416	6.647144	6.804013	6.685336	6.437257	6.776067	6.506722	6.491616	6.507683	6.650789	6.603532	6.545503	6.633067	6.445359	6.562318	6.647843	6.600416	6.594351	6.730238	6.600604	6.515589	6.61792	6.728725	6.602341	6.619182	6.862633	6.700186	6.528985	6.408482	6.669584	6.642504	6.644059	6.465837	6.417544	6.387811	6.561694	6.593678	6.578078	6.483611	6.481043	6.414593	6.59494	6.335579	6.574063	6.371412	6.533335	6.501731	6.576833	6.683657	6.614959	6.468822	6.697868	6.293818

The lipid bilayer surrounding any of the compartments of the Golgi apparatus [goid 139] [evidence IEA]; The irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. The ER takes two forms, rough (or granular), with ribosomes adhering to the outer surface, and smooth (with no ribosomes attached) [goid 5783] [evidence IEA]; The lipid bilayer surrounding the endoplasmic reticulum [goid 5789] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; Double layer of lipid molecules that encloses all cells, and, in eukaryotes, many organelles; may be a single or double lipid bilayer; also includes associated proteins [goid 16020] [evidence IEA]; Penetrating at least one phospholipid bilayer of a membrane. May also refer to the state of being buried in the bilayer with no exposure outside the bilayer.
